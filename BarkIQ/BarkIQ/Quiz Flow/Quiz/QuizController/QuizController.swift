/// A stateful controller that manages quiz progression, question generation, and result tracking.
///
/// This class is marked as `@Observable` to allow SwiftUI to respond to state changes like
/// transitioning from a question to results or showing a loading state. However, it aims to remain
/// as lightweight and intentional as possible, without leaning heavily on the observable pattern
/// for everything.
///
/// Only `currentState` is publicly reactive ‚Äî most internal state (like question number and results)
/// is kept private to prevent accidental UI coupling.
///
/// The controller handles:
/// - Fetching breeds
/// - Generating randomized multiple-choice questions
/// - Tracking which answers were selected
/// - Returning a final results summary at the end
@Observable
